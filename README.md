# binarycity

I tried to decode a gibberish text file that I found on the [music video](https://youtu.be/ugpywe34_30) of my favorite artist ZUTOMAYO.
About [0:20](https://youtu.be/ugpywe34_30?t=20) on the video, there is a QR code that sent me to a [Dropbox file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xjsisog7a9g672v/binarycity.txt).

I know this is nothing special, but I was not that knowledgeable back then so I am still proud that I managed to decode a cryptic text. My process is shown in [binarycity.py](binarycity.py).
